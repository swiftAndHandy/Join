            <p>Welcome to the help page for <a href="index.html">Join</a> your guide to using our kanban project
                management tool. Here, we'll
                provide an overview of what
                <a href="index.html">Join</a> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
            </p>
            <h2>What is Join?</h2>

            <p><a href="index.html">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
                dedicated students as part of their web
                development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br><br>

                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize
                efficiency (or flow). <a href="index.html">Join</a> leverages the principles of kanban to help users
                manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
                interface.<br><br>

                It is important to note that <a href="index.html">Join</a> is designed as an educational exercise and is
                not intended for extensive business usage. While we
                strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability,
                reliability, accuracy, or other aspects
                of quality regarding <a href="index.html">Join</a>.</p>

            <h2>How to use it</h2>
            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a href="index.html">Join</a>:</p>

                        <p>When you log in to <a href="index.html">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board
                            represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
                            "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".</p>

                        <p>In <a href="index.html">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to
                            the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in
                            the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can
                            interact with the tasks on the
                            board.</p>

                        <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                            tasks. Click the "+" button under
                            the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task
                            name, description, due date, assignees,
                            etc.</p>

                        <span class="subheadline">Moving Cards</span>
                        <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging
                            and dropping the card from one
                            list to another.</p>

                    <div class="article">
                        <span class="subheadline">Deleting Cards</span>
                        <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                            card will permanently remove it from
                            the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
